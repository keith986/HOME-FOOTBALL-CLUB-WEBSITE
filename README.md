# HOME-FOOTBALL-CLUB-WEBSITE
Hello everyone, I am aspiring to become a frontend developer. This is something I decided to work on it so as to check my level of coding skills. Let me know what's your thought on this. 
ABOUT:
This a football team with user profile page.You can change your profile photo and delete your account.User profile page has access to your login detailss with a delete account option.Its a fun site and also classy for your home football team/club.It also has player tab with FIFA like profile.It's not properly done and forgot to put some margin and padding cause i was in a hurry to complete it.It also has a PHPMailer for sending your mail.Its really simplified.I would encourage you to use PHPMailer to send your mails cause it works.
Tell me what you think about this.
